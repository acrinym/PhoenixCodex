They have a few cool tools but nothing that I couldn't find for free. So that's how I know my skills are better than the geek squad😋. So, if you ever have computer issues.. I'm very good with them 😁",

I always put a pan lid in the pan so it Cooks better and that way I don't necessarily have to flip it because it Cooks the whole thing and usually just leave it on low the whole time but then after they're done and I turn off the burner they finish cooking. Couple different ways to do it but that's not really making an omelette lol",

You have to exert twice the effort to stay upright, as you're trying not to fall and keep your balance at the same time as running. I took that, then turning around to walk sideways with the other leg dominant, then after I did both for a few minutes, twisting while walking sideways and alternating between legs. Holy crap that's intense! Sweat my butt off.",

I made it during a time when I was trying to rebuild myself, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I was working on remembering that I didn’t have to be perfect to be enough...That I didn’t have to have everything together to still be valuable. That I could still move forward, even in the middle of the storm. It was kind of like me talking to myself from the other side of the hard stuff. A reminder that no matter what, I’m whole. And maybe that reminder is useful for someone else too I actually read a lot of music like this for that purpose. Because sometimes I have to remember who I am, not who I was.",

Hope your week’s been good ☺️ Also, I found this earlier—thought it was kind of along both of our vibes: https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=1562272177779909&vanity=100078268117321",

I'm going to build some resonating circuits as soon as I have the materials to do it, but right now I've actually been focused on building web technologies that people can use and would definitely pay for...

You’ve been pushed, pulled, knocked over, hurt... And I’d rather go to my grave than ever be the one who adds to that. I’ve held these things for months, not knowing how or when to say them... But I needed you to know this part. If you do sleep(and I hope you can)— May it be gentle. May you dream in peace.

I was laying with my feet in the water on a Sandy bank that was naturally carved by the waves and just laid back in the sand for a half hour or so and I was sweating to death so I had to stop. Totally relaxing though.. but now I'm sunburned. I don't usually wear sunblock, but I totally forgot about sunburns 🤭 oops Passed out today earlier from being so worn out from being in the sun. But I had a good time at the beach. Was there till after 1:00.. then I stopped by a DNR person who set up a butterfly table at the entrance to the beach and talked about the forest service lol Oh! I didn't find any flowers at the beach but I did find this guy.. I pulled him up out of the water to see what kind of turtle he was and it was a soft shell spiny turtle. My first time ever touching or seeing a soft shell turtle and it was amazing. 😊 I'm really happy I found it. Went right back into the water a few minutes after being taken out. May you dream sweetly, sleep cooled off, and may your night be good and restful, Amanda 💫🌌🧊🍃",
