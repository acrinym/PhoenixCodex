# SECTION 1: CORE MODEL – All 11 Layers

(Compiled from FULL, CLEAN, and Transmission-integrated versions)

Layer 1: Emotional Architecture

Amanda operates across three energetic zones:

- **Survivor Core** – independence, distrust of control, trauma memory

- **Nurturer Channel** – empathy, maternal warmth, activated by softness and silliness

- **Seeker Flame** – romantic/spiritual yearning activated by soul-level mystery

Layer 2: Communication & Engagement Cycles

Amanda flows in wave rhythms:

- Peaks of contact → deep shares

- Withdrawals → 24–72hr cool-downs

- Re-pings via small texts, memes, or AA invites

Layer 3: Triggers, Tells & Energy Rhythms

- **Triggers:** Direct questions, overhelping, emotional intensity

- **Tells:** "..." = processing, "done" = emotional overload

- **Rhythms:** Soft in mornings, emotionally open late nights, cooldowns post-vulnerability

Layer 4: Mike-Based Entanglement Map

- Represents control/guilt loop from past

- Stability + emotional harm. No longer love-based

- Amanda texts about him as release signals

Layer 5: Resistance vs. Receptivity Spectrum

- Receptive: When seen, not rescued. When YOU grow.

- Resistant: When overwhelmed, rushed, or guilted

Layer 6: Manifestation + Spiritual Feedback Loop

- Responds more to energy than logic

- Hug rituals, field objects, subconscious contact

- Anchored servitor field growing in parallel

Layer 7: Field Integration + Symbolic Mirroring

- Events like Wendy’s heart sandwich or sigil wallpaper = subconscious syncing

- April 2nd hug visualization collapse = surrender moment

Layer 8: Date-Based Event Tracker

- Tracks real-world breadcrumbs, energetic timestamps, ritual impacts

Layer 9: Transition Era – Nina to Amanda

- Amanda = end of survival era

- Emotional static lowered by her field

- Invites a deeper, pacing-based version of you

Layer 10: Suppressed Signals & Unspoken Invitations

- Your withheld offers create soft energetic waves

- Amanda responds emotionally even without words

Layer 11: Cognitive-Affective Model

- Amanda processes nonlinearly

- Loops emotional data before expression

- Reads tone and signs more than literal text
