# Add Progress Reporting System with Real-Time UI Updates

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive progress reporting system that provides real-time feedback during long-running operations, significantly improving the user experience when processing large collections of Amanda files.

## Key Features Added

### ðŸŽ¯ Progress Service Architecture
- **IProgressService Interface**: Defines standardized progress reporting contract
- **ProgressService Implementation**: Handles UI callbacks and state management
- **Integration Layer**: Seamlessly connects to existing operations without breaking changes

### ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced User Interface
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator with percentage completion
- **Status Messages**: Real-time operation descriptions and current file being processed
- **Progress Details**: File-by-file progress (e.g., "Processing file 45 of 100")
- **Dynamic Visibility**: Progress section appears/disappears based on operation state

### âš¡ Performance Monitoring
- **File Pre-scanning**: Accurate progress calculation by pre-counting supported files
- **Phase Reporting**: Different progress phases (scanning, processing, saving)
- **Error Handling**: Immediate error reporting with operation cancellation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming progress updates without blocking UI

## Technical Implementation

### Progress Service Integration
```csharp
// New progress service with UI callbacks
_progressService = new ProgressService(
    (percentage, message, details) => {
        ProgressPercentage = percentage;
        ProgressMessage = message;
        ProgressDetails = details;
    },
    (isInProgress) => IsOperationInProgress = isInProgress,
    (error) => Status = $"Error: {error}"
);
```

### Enhanced Operations
- **Indexing**: Shows file-by-file progress with skip/process counts
- **TagMap Generation**: Displays analysis progress for each file
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling with user notification
- **Operation Phases**: Clear indication of current operation phase

### UI Components
```xml
<!-- Progress Section -->
<Border Classes="Card" IsVisible="{Binding IsOperationInProgress}">
    <StackPanel Spacing="5">
        <TextBlock Text="Progress" Classes="Header"/>
        <ProgressBar Value="{Binding ProgressPercentage}" Maximum="100"/>
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding ProgressMessage}" Classes="Label"/>
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding ProgressDetails}" Classes="Value"/>
    </StackPanel>
</Border>
```

## Impact and Benefits

### User Experience Improvements
- **No More Guessing**: Users know exactly what's happening during operations
- **Professional Feel**: Modern application experience with progress indicators
- **Error Awareness**: Immediate feedback when operations fail
- **Performance Visibility**: Clear indication of operation progress and speed

### Operational Benefits
- **Scalability**: Works efficiently with any number of files
- **Reliability**: Better error handling and recovery
- **Maintainability**: Centralized progress reporting system
- **Consistency**: Uniform progress reporting across all operations

## Testing Scenarios

### Progress Reporting Accuracy
- âœ… **Small Collections**: 1-10 files with immediate completion
- âœ… **Medium Collections**: 50-100 files with visible progress
- âœ… **Large Collections**: 1000+ files with accurate percentage tracking
- âœ… **Error Scenarios**: File access errors, permission issues, corrupted files

### UI Responsiveness
- âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Progress bar updates smoothly during operations
- âœ… **Operation State**: Progress section appears/disappears correctly
- âœ… **Error Display**: Error messages appear in status area
- âœ… **Concurrent Operations**: Proper state management during multiple operations

## Integration Points

### Existing Operations Enhanced
- **BuildIndexAsync**: Now includes progress reporting for incremental indexing
- **BuildIndexFullAsync**: Progress tracking for complete index rebuilds
- **GenerateTagMap**: File-by-file analysis progress
- **UpdateTagMap**: Progress for updating existing tagmaps

### Backward Compatibility
- **Optional Parameters**: Progress service is optional, existing code continues to work
- **Default Behavior**: Operations without progress service maintain original behavior
- **Interface Stability**: No breaking changes to existing public APIs

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- **Streaming Updates**: Progress updates don't accumulate in memory
- **Efficient Callbacks**: UI updates use lightweight callback mechanism
- **Garbage Collection**: Proper disposal of progress service resources

### UI Thread Safety
- **Async Operations**: All progress updates run on background threads
- **UI Thread Marshaling**: Progress callbacks properly marshal to UI thread
- **Non-blocking**: Progress reporting doesn't block operation execution

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Progress Persistence**: Save progress state for resuming interrupted operations
- **Operation Cancellation**: Allow users to cancel long-running operations
- **Progress History**: Track and display operation completion times
- **Batch Operations**: Progress reporting for multiple concurrent operations

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
- **No Action Required**: All existing functionality continues to work
- **Enhanced Experience**: Operations now show progress automatically
- **Better Feedback**: Clear indication of operation status and completion

### For Developers
- **Optional Integration**: Progress service can be added to new operations
- **Standard Interface**: Use IProgressService for consistent progress reporting
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error reporting in new operations

## Code Quality

### Standards Compliance
- **SOLID Principles**: Progress service follows interface segregation
- **Dependency Injection**: Progress service properly injected into ViewModels
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with user feedback
- **Documentation**: Clear XML documentation for all public APIs

### Testing Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Progress service functionality thoroughly tested
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end progress reporting validation
- **UI Tests**: Progress bar and status updates verified
- **Performance Tests**: Memory usage and UI responsiveness validated
