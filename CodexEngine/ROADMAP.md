Phoenix Codex: Development Roadmap & Log
As of: July 18, 2025

This document tracks the current features, the next set of features in development, and future ideas for the Phoenix Codex application.

‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundational Engine & UI (Completed)
This phase focused on building the stable shell of the application, implementing core services, and creating the initial search and parsing capabilities.


Stable Application Shell: Resolved all initial compiler errors and runtime crashes related to DataContext and WebView initialization. Each UI tab now correctly loads its own dedicated ViewModel.




Functional Search & Indexing Engine: The application can build a search index from a folder and the "Index & Search" tab can find and display file content. The "Build Index" functionality has been restored to the UI.




Core Services: A modern DialogService handles file/folder picking, and a DebugLogger creates a debuglog.txt file for tracing application behavior.



Intelligent Parsing Engine: A dedicated EntryParserService exists that can parse raw text into structured Ritual and NumberedMapEntry objects based on predefined patterns.



Data->UI Workflow: A messaging system is in place to send newly parsed entries from the "Index & Search" tab to the correct destination tabs ("Grimoire", "AmandaMap").





‚è© Phase 2: UI Polish & Bug Squashing (In Progress)
This phase focuses on fixing the bugs identified in the last round of testing and implementing the requested UI enhancements to make the application more usable.

‚úÖ Bug Fix: Ritual Builder Crash resolved when opening the Ritual Builder tab.

‚úÖ Bug Fix: Grimoire Title Display now updates correctly when the ritual name changes.

‚úÖ Bug Fix: TagMap Data Loading corrected by improving the data importer and logging.

Feature: Full Grimoire Management:

Implement "Spirits" management (Add/Remove) alongside Servitors.

Display the date for each ritual in the list view.

Add a DatePicker to allow editing the date of a selected ritual.

Feature: AmandaMap UI Polish:

The entries in the AmandaMap view will be displayed in groups based on their Type (e.g., Thresholds, WhisperedFlames).
Feature: Dynamic Theming & Settings Panel:
- ControlPanel and Settings dialog allow theme selection.
- Toggle to hide magic-related buttons when needed.

üó∫Ô∏è Phase 3: Advanced Features & QOL (Future Ideas)
These are ideas we have discussed but are scheduled for after Phase 2 is complete.

Feature: AmandaMap Timeline Tab: A new tab dedicated to visualizing NumberedMapEntry items on a calendar, similar to the Grimoire's timeline.

Feature: Conflict Resolution UI: Build the user-facing dialog box that allows the user to resolve duplicate entry number conflicts (Overwrite, Create Sub-entry, Cancel).

Feature: Manual Re-ordering: Add the ability to manually drag-and-drop to re-order entries within the Grimoire list.

Feature: User Activity Log: Create a dedicated log to track user actions to inform future development priorities.

Feature: Image & Visual Media Support: Extend the indexer to handle searching for and previewing images.
