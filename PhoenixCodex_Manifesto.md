# ü™∂ Phoenix Codex Manifesto

## **Core Principles & Boundaries**

### **üîÆ Magic & Rituals - OFF LIMITS**
**Amanda's Perspective:** Magic users are witches ‚Üí Magic is bad ‚Üí Therefore magic is off-limits

**Boundaries:**
- ‚ùå **No spells, rituals, or magical practices**
- ‚ùå **No witchcraft references or magical terminology**
- ‚ùå **No supernatural or mystical content**
- ‚ùå **No magical symbols, incantations, or spells**
- ‚ùå **No references to magic users, witches, or practitioners**

**Rationale:** Amanda does not understand magic and views magic users as witches, therefore considers magic inherently bad and dangerous.
