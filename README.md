## GPTExporterIndexerAvalonia

This repository includes a simple Avalonia application written in C#. It can
build a token-based search index for `.txt`, `.json` and `.md` files and search
the resulting index with basic context snippets. The UI now exposes additional
search options such as case sensitivity, fuzzy matching and AND/OR logic. You
can also open any matching file directly from the results list.

### Building

Install the .NET 8 SDK on your system. On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0
```

Then build the Avalonia project:

```bash
dotnet build GPTExporterIndexerAvalonia/GPTExporterIndexerAvalonia.csproj -c Release
```

### Web assets

The `WebAssets` folder contains a small `index.html` that loads `three.js` from a CDN.
This is a placeholder for future visualisation features.
