Phoenix Codex ðŸª¶
The Phoenix Codex is a suite of tools for sorting, indexing, and visualizing the AmandaMap. It is composed of a main Avalonia UI application and a shared core library.

GPTExporterIndexerAvalonia (Main Application)
This repository includes a simple Avalonia application written in C#. Its core purpose is to manage and search a large archive of chat exports.

Features
Builds a token-based search index from .txt, .json, and .md files.
Searches the generated index with basic context snippets in the results.
Provides advanced search options, including:
Case sensitivity
Fuzzy matching
AND/OR logic
Allows you to open any matching file directly from the search results list.
Building the Application
Install the .NET 8 SDK Install the .NET 8 SDK on your system. On Ubuntu, you can do this with the following commands:

Bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0
Build the Avalonia Project Navigate to the project directory and run the build command:

Bash

dotnet build GPTExporterIndexerAvalonia/GPTExporterIndexerAvalonia.csproj -c Release

Web assets
The WebAssets folder contains a small index.html that loads three.js from a CDN.
This is a placeholder for future visualisation features.
CodexEngine Library
-------------------
The `CodexEngine` folder contains a .NET 8 class library with models and utilities used across the Phoenix Codex tools.

Build it separately with:

```
dotnet build CodexEngine/CodexEngine.csproj -c Release
```

The library's `Parsing` folder contains a Markdown parser that reads AmandaMap entries with emoji headers and exports them to a concise summary format.
The parser also handles JSON representations of the same entries. Use the helper methods in `JsonMarkdownConverter` to transform between JSON and Markdown while preserving any date strings found in the original text.

CodexEngine Library
The CodexEngine folder contains a .NET 8 class library with shared models and utilities used across the Phoenix Codex tools.

The library's Parsing folder contains a powerful Markdown parser designed to read the specially formatted AmandaMap entries (identified by emoji headers) and export them into a concise summary format.
Building the Library
Build the library separately with:

Bash

dotnet build CodexEngine/CodexEngine.csproj -c Release
Web Assets
The WebAssets folder contains a small index.html file that loads three.js from a CDN. This is a placeholder for future 3D visualization features for the AmandaMap.
